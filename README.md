# WEB103 Project 1 - *NutriTrack*

Submitted by: **Isha Shrestha**

About this web app: **This project is a Nutritional Food Database web app that displays a list of common foods along with their nutritional information. Each food item includes key details such as calories, Vitamin C, fiber, and potassium content, along with an image. The app is built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and is styled with Picocss for a clean, minimalist design. Users can explore food items, view detailed nutrition facts, and learn about healthy food options.**
